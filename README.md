# Shut-the-Box
The old English board game played with dice. 
The object of the game is to eliminate all the numbered tabs on the game board. 
Dice are rolled with a first click, then "tossed" onto the board with a second click. 
The player clicks on the numbered tabs that will equal the sum of the dice.
The "Next" button moves the players through their tosses and turns. 
When all have had a turn, the game ends indicating who had the lowest points, i.e., the winner.
If a player happens to eliminate all the tabs during their turn, they win and the game ends, and they can "shut the box."

This first iteration doesn't include persistent memory. A second iteration will in order to keep track of their tosses and turns, and keep a record of wins should they wish to continue play at another time.
